# Customer-Segmentation

This is an exploratory data visualization project that aims to unravel gain opportunities for a chain of supermarkets. The Company was losing revenue and in need of a strategic review. The results are also displayed in a Shiny app. 

There are several files in this repository: global.R, ui.R and server.R . 
These files conform together the shiny app. Beware that the directory in the global file needs to be updated to the one in which you store the data in your computer in order to run the app.
