# Customer-Segmentation

This is an exploratory data visualization project that aims to unravel gain opportunities for a chain of supermarkets. The Company was losing revenue and in need of a strategic review. The results are also displayed in a Shiny app. 

There are several files in this repository:

1. R files: global.R, ui.R and server.R are the files conforming the shiny app. Beware that the directory where the data is needs to be updated in the global file to the one in your computer in order to run the app. 

2. supermarket_sales.csv: data corresponding to 3 branches of a supermarket chain in Burma. The dataset has 17 variables and 1,000 observations. The csv containing 
the data is called 'supermarket_sales.csv'.

3. Customer_segmentation.pptx: short PPT presentation to introduce the shiny app.
